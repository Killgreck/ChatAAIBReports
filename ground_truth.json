It is equipped with eight propulsion motors.  Six motors are installed under the \nwings, and these provide vertical takeoff and landing capability.  Two motors are mounted at \nthe front of the wings that provide propulsion during forward flight.  The MTOW of the aircraft \nis 52 kg with a cruise speed of 60 kt and maximum range of 54 nm.\nThe aircraft is controlled remotely from a ground control station, and by an optional \nSRP controller.  The ground control station to aircraft communications system provides \nuninterrupted signals that enable the aircraft to be operated BVLOS.  The signals between \nthe SRP controller and aircraft are limited by range and line of sight.\nAt the time of report publication, 26 aircraft have been manufactured, of which 20 remain \nin operational service.  The accident aircraft had accumulated a total of 13 hours and  \n59 minutes flight time and had completed 119 flights prior to the accident.  This was the first \naccident involving this type.\n \nFigure 3\nPW Orca \n(used with permission)\n19\nAll times are UTC\u00a9  Crown copyright 2025\n AAIB",

The ailerons also move to place the aircraft \ninto a spin, which is intended to quickly reduce any forward movement of the aircraft as it \ndescends.  This system can bring the aircraft safely to the ground at a controlled rate in \nthe event of an emergency.  The aircraft manufacturer\u2019s minimum deployable height for the \nparachute to be fully effective is 60 m above the ground3.\nThe FTS activates automatically if the aircraft\u2019s descent rate exceeds 2,000 fpm, or it can \nbe manually triggered by selection of a terminate push button on the RP ground station or \nswitch on the SRP controller (Figure 4).\nArm and disarm function\nThe arm and disarm function applied or removed power to the electric propulsion motors \nrespectively and enabled or disabled remote control of the aircraft.  Upon landing the aircraft \nwas designed to automatically disarm itself, enabling it to be safely approached by ground \npersonnel.  The design of the system also allowed the aircraft to be manually disarmed \nwhen in flight or on the ground.\n",
            ".\nThe aircraft was observed to follow the planned flight profile but as it approached approximately \nthe halfway point the aircraft\u2019s motors suddenly stopped.  The aircraft initially maintained \naltitude but subsequently stalled, before descending quickly and striking the ground within \na wooded area (Figure 1).  No persons were injured and there was no damage to property; \nthe aircraft was damaged beyond repair.\nThe RP, SRP and PM reported that they had not made any selections on their respective \ncontrollers in the period before the aircraft departed from controlled flight.\nFootnote\n1 The VO is a designated person who assists the pilot during BVLOS flights.  The VO\u2019s primary responsibility is \nto maintain visual contact with the aircraft and its surroundings, alerting the remote pilot who may not be able \nto observe the aircraft to any potential hazards or conflicts.  The VO provides the visual mitigations required \nby the BVLOS VM authorisation.\n17\nAll times are UTC\u00a9  Crown copyright 2025\n AAIB Bulletin: 10/2025 PW Orca AAIB-30757\nFigure 1\nRelative position of takeoff, landing and accident sites\n\u00a9 2025 Google, Image \u00a9 2025 Airbus\nAccident site \nThe aircraft struck the ground in a wooded area (Figure 2) which was accessible to the \npublic.

            " he had not moved this switch during the flight.  It is therefore most likely that the \nselection was synchronised correctly with the RP after the aircraft had landed at the farm, \nbut a loss of synchronisation with the RP then occurred, with the selection remaining in the \ndisarm position when the aircraft took off.\nThe checklist used by the RP and SRP did not include a formal verification (check and \nchallenge) of the arm/disarm switch selection.  This increased the possibility that a loss of \nsynchronisation between the two remote pilots was not detected and this risk may have \nbeen further increased by conducting a number of flights in relatively quick succession.\nAlthough the SRP controller was inadvertently set in the disarm position when \ncommunication was established with the aircraft, this scenario had already been considered \nby the manufacturer that had designed the system so that it would not disarm the aircraft \nin this eventuality.  However, the change to the software in November 2024, which was not \nretested against the scenario above prior to its release, unintentionally resulted in the aircraft \ndisarming in flight.  This also disabled the FTS, which otherwise would have automatically \ndeployed the parachute.  The subsequent uncontrolled descent posed a safety hazard to \npeople and property on the ground.  Given the aircraft\u2019s weight, if it had struck a person, it \nis likely that serious or even fatal injuries may have occurred.\n26\nAll times are UTC\u00a9  Crown copyright 2025\n AAIB Bulletin: 10/2025 PW Orca AAIB",

The SRP controller \nselection had remained in the disarm position when the aircraft took off, and the software \nbug resulted in the unintended in-flight shutdown of the aircraft\u2019s electric propulsion motors, \nthe disabling of the aircraft\u2019s safety parachute system from deploying, and a subsequent \nuncontrolled descent from a height of 60 m.\nThis accident highlights the importance of ensuring that change management processes \ninclude comprehensive scenario testing, particularly for safety-critical functions.

When the aircraft came within range of the SRP\u2019s controller, this \nresulted in power being removed from the aircraft\u2019s electric propulsion motors, leading to \nthe aircraft stalling, its emergency parachute system being disabled, and a subsequent \nuncontrolled descent from a height of 60 m.\nHistory of the flight\nA number of flights were being flown a total distance of about 1.5 nm between a farm and a \nfield adjacent to Coventry Hospital (Figure 1).

He stated it was also difficult to \nkeep the aircraft straight whilst on the approach, although the pilot managed to carry out a \nsuccessful landing.  When taxiing after landing, the pilot noticed that there was damage to \na section of the trailing edge on the right wing, with some tears in the material.\nThe aircraft was later inspected but no other damage was found, and it was reported that \nthe damage to the wing was not considered to be due to an object coming off the aircraft \nor a strike by the aircraft\u2019s propeller.
